The following commands are the ones you will use most often during ROS 2 development.

For a full list of ROS 2 CLI commands, see the official documentation: [ROS 2 CLI Tools](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html)

:::tip[Tip]
If a command does not work as expected, check:
- Whether the correct environment is sourced
- Whether the node or service is actually running
- The exact topic, service, or action names using list commands
:::

## Build
- ```source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash```
  
  Loads the system-wide ROS 2 environment so ROS commands are available.

- ```source install/setup.bash```
  
  Loads your local workspace so ROS can find packages you built.

- ```colcon build```
  
  Builds all packages in the current ROS 2 workspace.

- ```colcon build --packages-select <package_name>```

  Builds only the specified package to save time.

- ```ros2 run <package> <executable>```
  
  Runs a specific node (executable) from a ROS 2 package. (e.g, use it to run a launch.py file)

## Topic
- ```ros2 topic list```
  
  Lists all currently active topics in the ROS 2 system.

- ```ros2 topic echo <topic name>```

  Prints messages being published on a topic to the terminal.

- ```ros2 interface show <topic_name>```
  
  Displays the structure of a message type used by a topic.

## Service
- ```ros2 service list```
  
  Lists all available services.

- ```ros2 service echo <service_name | service_type> ```

  see data communication between a service client and a service server.

- ```ros2 interface show <type_name>```

  Shows the request and response fields of a service type. 

## Action
- ```ros2 action list```

  Lists all active action servers in the system.

- ```ros2 action info <action_name>```
 
  Shows details about a specific action, including its type and goal/result topics.


## Visualization 

- ```ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames```

  Generates a visualization of the transformation frame tree in PDF.

## Control
- ```ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard```

  Controls a robot using keyboard input by publishing velocity commands.

Or you can run keyboard teleoperation with a remapped velocity topic using ``--remap`` flag:
- ```ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args --remap cmd_vel:=<your cmd_vel name>```
