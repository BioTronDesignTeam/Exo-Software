## Install Node.js
Install the latest stable version of Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)

After installation, open a terminal and verify that Node.js is installed correctly:
```bash
node --version
```
If a version number is displayed, Node.js has been successfully installed.

## Install project dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd Exo-Software/user-interface
# installs all dependencies listed in package.json
npm install
# ensures they are updated to compatible versions
npm update 
```

## Run the frontend development server
Start the local development server with:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command builds the frontend and launches a local server.

## View the application
Open the localhost URL printed in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the frontend.
Any code changes will automatically refresh the page.
