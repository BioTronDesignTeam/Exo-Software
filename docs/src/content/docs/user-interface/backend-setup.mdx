## Install Python
Install Python 3.10 or newer from the official website:

Verify the installation:
```bash
python --version
```
or on some systems,
```bash
python3 --version
```
If a version number is displayed, Python is installed correctly.

## Create and activate a virtual environment
A virtual environment keeps backend dependencies isolated.

Navigate to the backend directory and create a virtual environment:
```bash
cd Exo-Software/user-interface/backend
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
### Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### macOS/Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The requirements.txt file includes all dependencies needed for our app (e.g, websockets) 

## Run the websocket server
Open a terminal in VS Code or your system terminal, navigate to the backend directory, and start the WebSocket server:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Verify the websocket server
If the server starts successfully, the terminal will show that it is listening for connections.

You can verify the connection by:
- Opening the frontend application
- Using a WebSocket client (e.g., browser dev tools or wscat)
- Checking backend logs for incoming connections in a terminal

## Stop and deactivate
Stop the server with ```Ctrl + C```.

Deactivate the virtual environment when finished:
```bash
deactivate
```
