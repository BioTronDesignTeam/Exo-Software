## About the team
UW Exo is a student design team at the University of Waterloo participating in the Applied Collegiate Exoskeleton Competition (ACE) - a competition held every year and involving a dozen universities from across the world. 
Teams design a powered exoskeleton, primarily focused on lower-body mobility.
Teams develop exoskeleton with unique missions and payload requirements and are evaluated through a series of launch-readiness tests, including design review, safety test, judge piloting test, and mobility challenges.

## What software does
Software is a subteam consisting of three major code projects: user interface, firmware, and robot operating system (ROS).

The user interface is the operator’s control stage for the exoskeleton. 
It lets users monitor system status and command high-level states (idle, walking, emergency stop) 
and manage configuration and calibration data, such as motor PID constants, joint limits, and safety thresholds, in real time. 
The app is built with Python for the backend and React for the frontend.

The firmware runs on the microcontroller(MCU) and directly controls the actuators. 
It manages torque, position, and velocity control while continuously reading sensor data. 
It also handles communication with the user interface, robot operating sytem, motor drivers, and other electrical subsystems. 

ROS runs the high-level control logic for the exoskeleton, using sensor data from real hardwares or simulated sources (e.g., keyboard inputs).
It is where the PID control and gait prediction algorithms are implemented, and the processed outputs are deployed to either the physical system or the simulation.
