The following are the steps members should take when looking for and completing new tasks!

1. Ensure that you have confirmed with a Lead that the task is available to take and that you are able to work on said task.

2. When starting on your task branch from the main git repository, name your branch in the format: ```name/taskname```. 
   For example, a branch name could be ```sarah/add-docs```. This helps us track branches!

3. Work on your task and add everything needed to get your task to a point where it is ready for a preliminary review.

4. When ready for review, create a pull request on Github. Be sure to fill out the pull request template provided! 
   (see pr channel in exo discord).
