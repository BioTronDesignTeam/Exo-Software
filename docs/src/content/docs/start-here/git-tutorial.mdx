This guide explains the most common Git actions you’ll use when working on BioTron projects.
Git helps multiple people work on the same codebase without overwriting each other’s work.

If Git is not installed on your PC, please follow this installation guide: [Initial setup](/Exo-Software/start-here/initial-setup/)

If you don’t have access to the [Exo-Software repository](https://github.com/BioTronDesignTeam/Exo-Software) yet, 
request access by pinging ```@Sarah``` on Discord.

## 1. Check repository status
Before doing anything, it’s always good to see what Git thinks has changed.
```bash
git status
```
```git status``` shows which files were modified, which are staged, and which are untracked.

## 2. Stage changes
Staging means telling Git which changes you want to include in your next commit.

### Stage a specific file
```bash
git add filename
```

### Stage all changes
```bash
git add .
```
```git add``` moves files into the staging area, preparing them to be saved as a commit.

## 3. Commit changes
A commit is a snapshot of your staged changes with a message explaining what you did.
```bash
git commit -m "Add motor control logic"
```
```git commit``` saves your staged changes to your local Git history.
Please write clear, concise commit messages that explain why you made the change!

## 4. Push changes to the remote repository
Pushing sends your local commits to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
```bash
git push
```

If it’s your first push on a new branch:
```bash
git push -u origin branch-name
```

```git push``` uploads your commits so others can see and use them.


## 5. Create a new branch (sub-branching)
Branches let you work on features or fixes without affecting the main code.

### Create and switch to a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

### Switch between branches
```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

```git branch``` or ```git checkout -b``` creates an isolated workspace for your changes.

**Best practice**: always create a new branch for new features or bug fixes!

## 6. Pull latest changes
Before starting work (or before pushing), always pull the latest updates.
```bash
git pull
```
```git pull``` downloads and merges changes from the remote repository into your local branch.

## 7. Open a pull request (PR)
A pull request lets others review your changes before merging them into the main git branch.

Typical workflow:
- Create a new branch
- Make changes
- Stage and commit
- Push your branch
- Open a pull request on GitHub

After opening a Pull Request on GitHub, notify the software lead on Discord so it gets reviewed:
1. Go to the *Exo Pull Request thread* on Discord
2. Post a short message describing your PR
3. Ping ```@Sarah``` to request review

This prevents accidental breaking changes.
