We are still waiting for STM32H7 board to arrive.

## Software Pre-requisites
### Installing STM32CubeIDE
This is the main **IDE** that is used to edit STM specific code. You can use other software like `VSCode` or `Neovim` but you will have to set up the development environment on your own (thankfully, there are some resources online).

<Steps>
1. Create a myST account (STM account on their website).
2. Get the latest version for your operating system using the link: [https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
</Steps>

### Installing STM32CubeMX
This software is responsible for **file generation** of project files, HAL, etc. It is a great tool wrapped in an easy-to-use GUI and is a must have when developing with STM boards.
